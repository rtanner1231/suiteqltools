## Sql Formatter options

The SQL formatter function uses the [sql-formatter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sql-formatter) library.  Refer to the documentation there for information about the individual options.

## Query Run options

- **initialMode** (*default: "table"*) - The type of output running a query will initially produce.  "table" will show the results in a table.  "json" will show the raw JSON structure of the results.
- **jsonFormatSpace** (*default: 4*) - The number of spaces to indent the JSON output of the query
- **pageSize** (*default: 10*) - The number of results to retrieve per page
- **envVars**
  - **encryptKey** (*default: "NVIMQueryKey"*) - The environmental variable which will hold the encryption key for the Oauth tokens storage.  See setup for more information.
- **editorKeymap** - Override default query editor keys.  These keymaps will only be set in the sql editor.
  - **formatQuery** (*default: "\<C-s\>s"*) - Keymap to format the query in the editor
  - **toggleWindow** (*default: "\<C-s\>w"*) - Keymap to toggle focus between the editor and result panes

# Commands
This plugin provides the below commands
- ```:SuiteQL FormatQuery``` - Format the SuiteQL query under the cursor.  Does nothing if there is no query under the cursor.
- ```:SuiteQL FormatFile``` - Formats all SuiteQL queries in the current file.
- ```:SuiteQL AddProfile``` - Create a new profile for a Netsuite account.  Running this command will prompt you for a profile name and then an account id and Oauth 1.0 tokens for the account.  Using an existing profile name will overwrite that profile.  Multiple profiles may be created.
- ```:SuiteQL SelectProfile``` - Open a floating window to select the profile which will be used when running SuiteQL queries.  Press the number beside a profile or put the cursor over the profiles line and press enter to select.  Escape to cancel.
- ```:SuiteQL DeleteProfile``` - Open a floating window to delete a profile.  The active profile may not be deleted.  Press the number beside a profile or put the cursor over the profiles line and press enter to select.  Escape to cancel.
- ```:SuiteQL ResetTokens``` - Remove all saved profiles.  This cannot be undone.   
- ```:SuiteQL ToggleEditor``` - Toggles the query editor open and closed.  Closing the query editor preserves the current state and will be restored when it is reopened.
- ```:SuiteQL EditQuery``` - Open the query editor with the SuiteQL query under the cursor.  Does nothing if there is no query under the cursor.
- ```:SuiteQL History``` - Opens the a [Telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim) picker for searching query history.  Does nothing is history configuration option is false.
- ```:SuiteQL SetCompletionData``` - Open a dialog to import completion data for the current active profile.  Does nothing if the completion feature is not enabled.

# Setup
Running SuiteQL queries requires Oauth tokens to be setup and saved.  These tokens will be encrypted and stored in a file called sqc in the vim standard data folder.

1. Set an encryption key.  Create an environmental variable called NVIMQueryKey (or what you set queryRun.envVars.encryptKey to in the config).  For example add ```export NVIMQueryKey=ABCDEF12345``` to your .bashrc file to set ABCDEF12345 as the encryption key.
2. Generate oauth tokens in your Netsuite environments.  These tokens will need to be created with a role that has at least view access to any table you would like to write queries for.  **Never use tokens created from a production environment with this plugin**
3. Run ```:SuiteQL AddProfile``` in Neovim.  Follow the prompts to create a profile for a Netsuite account and assign OAuth tokens to it.

# Usage

## How queries in code are identified

In order for a string to be considered a SuiteQL query by this plugin, it must be the following:
1. In a javascript or typescript file.
2. Enclosed in backticks (a string literal)
3. Have the first word be "select" or "with" (Case insensitive)

### Examples
${\textsf{\color{lightgreen}This would be considered a SuiteQL query}}$

```
const q=`
    select
    id
    from
    location
`
```

The following would not be considered SuiteQL queries

${\textsf{\color{red}Not enclosed in backticks}}$
```
const q="select id from location"
```
 
${\textsf{\color{red}Does not start with s√©lect or with}}$

```

const q=`
    --comment
    select
    id
    from
    location
`
```

## Syntax highlighting

Any string which satisfies the above rules to be considered a SuiteQL query will automatically have syntax highlighting applied.

## Formatting

A SuiteQL query may be formatted by using commands ```:SuiteQL FormatQuery``` to format the query under the cursor or ```:SuiteQL FormatFile``` to format all SuiteQL queries in the file.

This uses the [sql-formatter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sql-formatter) library.  The formatted preferences may be set in the plugin configuration.  The following options are exposed, refer to the sql-formatter documentation for information about what they do
- language
- tabWidth
- useTabs
- keywordCase
- indentStyle
- logicalOperatorNewline
- expressionWidth
- denseOperators
- newLineBeforeSemicolon

## Managing profiles

To run queries against a Netsuite environment, a profile must be set up for that environment.  A profile contains the Netsuite account number and OAuth tokens for connecting.  Multiple profiles may be set up but only one may be the active profile at a time.  Queries are run against the active profile.
- Use ```:SuiteQL AddProfile``` to create a profile.  Follow the prompts to enter a profile name, Netsuite account number, and Oauth token information.  If the profile name already exists, it will be overwritten.  The first profile created will automatically be set as the active profile.
- Change the active profile with the ```:SuiteQL SelectProfile``` command.  This will show a floating window with all profiles listed.  The current active profile will have a star next to its name.  Placing the cursor over a line and pressing enter or pressing the number next to a profile will make that profile active.  Press escape to cancel.
- Delete a profile with the ```:SuiteQL DeleteProfile``` command.  This will show a floating window with all profiles lists.  The current active profile will have a star next to its name.  Placing the cursor over a line and pressing enter or pressing the number next to a profile will delete the profile.  The active profile may not be deleted.  Press escape to cancel.
- Remove all profiles with the ```:SuiteQL ResetTokens``` command.  This will delete all saved data for this plugin.

## Edit and Run Query

The query edit may be opened with the following commands
- ```:SuiteQL ToggleEditor``` - Opens the editor.  If the editor had previously been open, opens to the most recent state.
- ```:SuiteQL EditQuery``` - Open the query under the cursor in the query editor.  Does nothing if there is no query under the cursor.

The Query editor may be closed with the ```:SuiteQL ToggleEditor``` command.

The query editor consists of three sections: the editor pane, the results pane, and the status bar
![SuiteQLEditorPanes](https://github.com/rtanner1231/suiteqltools.nvim/assets/142627958/cb10795c-4282-4c6f-81e9-7a9ce0c41f7e)

- Queries should be written in the editor pane.  Press the **runQuery** keymap (default \<C-s\>r) to run the query.
- Format the query in the editor pane with the **formatQuery** keymap (default \<C-s\>s).
- Toggle the cursor between the editor and results window with the **toggleWindow** keymap (default \<C-s\>w).
- Navigate between pages with the **nextPage** (default \<C-s\>n) and **previousPage** (default \<C-s\>p) keymaps.  The status bar will show the max number of pages and the current page.
- Toggle between maximizing and shrinking the results pane with the **toggleResultZoom** keymap (default \<C-s\>f).  Maximizing the result pane will automatically focus the result pane.  Shrinking the result pane will automatically focus the editor pane.
- Toggle between showing the results as a table and showing the results as JSON using the **toggleDisplayMode** keymap (default \<C-s\>m).

*Running queries using the suitetalk rest service which has the following quirks:*
- Any columns with null in every row is not returned
- Columns may be returned in a different order then the query specifies.

## History
Tracking query history can optionally be enabled (See Configuration Options).  Requires [telescope.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim) 
- Successful queries will be saved in history.
- Query history can be viewed using the ```:SuiteQL History``` command.  Queries may be searched using the search bar.  Press enter on a query to open it in the query editor.
- Queries are stored in the neovim data directory in a file called suiteqlhistory.json.  This file can be removed to clear the history.

Demo: Search query history, open selected query in editor, run query.
![suiteqlhistory](https://github.com/rtanner1231/suiteqltools.nvim/assets/142627958/19b83c42-9e06-42e7-bfc0-0c76904c4da6)

# Completion
*Note: this feature is experimental*
![autocomplete](https://github.com/rtanner1231/suiteqltools.nvim/assets/142627958/60916e7d-3922-449d-b200-0ae2aef35435)

This feature enables offline autocomplete for tables and fields in the query editor.
## Setup
- Ensure you have the [nvim-cmp](https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp) plugin installed.
- Set the **completion** property to true in the plugin configuration.
- You will need to extract the table and field data from your Netsuite environment.  Download the file located at *netsuitescripts/loadcompletion.html* in this repository. Load this file into your Netsuite filecabinet and open it.  Press the Run button to begin the extraction process.  Once complete, copy the value in the Results field into to the clipboard.  More information about how this works can be found in [this](https://timdietrich.me/blog/netsuite-records-catalog-api/) blog post.

- Next load the table and field data into Neovim.  Ensure the active profile is the one which corresponds to environment the data was downloaded from (run ```:SuiteQL SelectProfile``` to change if needed).  Run ```:SuiteQL SetCompletionData```.  In the dialog that appears, paste the results of the SuiteQL Completion Data tool and press enter.
- Repeat for any other profiles.
- Completion should now be active.

## Usage
- Table completion will trigger after the string *"from"* and *"join"* followed by whitespace (Case insensitive).  *Note: There is currently an issue where the table completion will not trigger at the beginning of a line, even if from or join preceded it line above.  In this case, adding a space at the start of the line should make it trigger.*
- Field completion will trigger after a . (period).  Completion without a table or alias is not currently supported.  *Note: The query must be reletively well formed to be able to resolve the tables and aliases.  If the tables and aliases are unable to be resolved, the completion will not trigger* 




# A note on security
Oauth tokens are encrypted and stored in the neovim Data Directory (see ```:h standard-path``` in Neovim) in a file called **sqc**.  The encryption key used is retrived from the environmental variable *NVIMQueryKey*.  The name of this environmental variable can be changed in the configuration.

**This method is not fully secure and anyone with access to your system and knowledge of this plugin could easily retrieve the Oauth tokens.  Never enter tokens from a production environment.**
